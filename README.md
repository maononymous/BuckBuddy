# User Roles and Persona
## Oakley and Co
Ehab lives with his friends at Oakley, sharing epxenses is a practice done very often. Ehab is always on his toes to pay the bill anywhere the friends go, to earn as much points as he can on his Credit Card. As a result he needs to do the tedious job of maintaining track of who owes him how much. Since the group is big enough to not fit on his fingers, it is difficult to keep track of everyone and every transaction in mind, and it is very inefficient to login to the credit card account every time to calculate the outstandings of any person.
- Frustration: Failing to collect back the contributions before credit card payment due date, resulting in fall of his credit score.
- Goal with BuckBuddy: Add friends to a group on the app, logging an expense everytime a transaction is done on his credit card, and adding specific people participating in the tranaction, to have the balances a glance away.
## DAZN Pvt Ltd
Sanjay spends most of his daily time in office, and then on weekends he hangs out with his office friends as well. As a result, he doesn't pay at any place, rather pays his friends on the pay day by settling his balances of the previous month. For this, he needs to keep a tab on how much he owes to each colleague, which has been becoming a hastle with his increase in expenses, resulting in over-expenditures.
- Frustration: Failing to keep track of monthly expenses done through his colleagues, resulting in overspending and effecting the savings.
- Goal with BuckBuddy: Quickly add expenses, keep track of total expenditures and plan ahead.
